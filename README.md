karuiwm
=======

karuiwm is an attempt to write a lightweight, dynamically tiling window manager
for X.

It is currently under heavy development and rather unusable.

In case you want to use it, the last somewhat usable commit is
[#31a8063](https://github.com/ayekat/karuiwm/tree/31a8063da9f3960e268514952b92d9c9ce5719ee).

TODO
----

* unify x-offset for printing strings (statusbar vs WSDbar)
* updatewsd() => updatewsdmap()
* initws() => move to right position
* init*() => setup*()
* initclient() => manage()
* tile() (and possibly other layouts) => layout.h
* add client counter on WSD box
* re-examine focusin()/focusout() (why did that bug?)

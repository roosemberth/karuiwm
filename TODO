IMPORTANT
---------
* handle client hints
  - dialog/transient windows
  - urgent hints
  - fix mplayer fullscreen state (also there was a buggy behaviour once that
    made it crash; will try to reproduce that) (issue #1)
* fix scratchpad "unpadding" to floating issue (#2)
  - generally: save sizes for different states
* add monocle layout and layout toggling

LESS IMPORTANT
--------------
* multiple scratchpads (issue #3)
* rules (floating/fullscreen/scratchpad)

NICE TO HAVE
------------
* "workspace-symlinking" (for making a workspace accessible at multiple locations)
* differ between verbose and debug messages
* switch to an empty workspace
  - improve monitor-to-workspace placing algorithm
